# ðŸ›’ E-Commerce Clone Project

This project is a simple front-end clone of an e-commerce website's homepage, created for the Web Midterm Project. It dynamically loads content using mock APIs.

## ðŸ“Š Data Sources

The project utilizes mock APIs hosted on [mocky.io](https://designer.mocky.io) to simulate fetching data from a backend.

- I used `https://productplaceholder.com` for placeholder images.
- In the `mock_data` folder, you can see the responses of the mock APIs.
